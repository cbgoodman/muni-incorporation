## Description

This repository contains the **R** code and raw text files needed to create an individual-level and state-specific dataset of dates of municipal incorporation for all active (included in the Census of Governments) municipalities in the United States.

These data generally are not self-reported by the incorporated government. These data are sourced from state-level actors, primarily state agencies responsible for tracking incorporations or state municipal leagues that collect data on their members. Importantly, these data are the first recognized date of incorporation. Many states allow re-incorporation (reasonably common in the late 1800s as statutory incorporation became popular, as opposed to incorporation via an act of the state legislature) that muddy the waters of when a place formed a municipal government.

## Citation

While there is a working paper forthcoming (please cite it when it comes out), I want to get these data into the world. As such, please cite this GitHub repo (see `Cite this repository' to the right).

## Contents of /code/
Run the following scripts to create the individual-level and state-specific extracts. The running the code will update and replace the contents of the /exports/ folder. The code is best run after creating an r project in the root directory of the repository.
* `muni-disincorp.r` - creates individual-level disincorporations data (**EXPERIMENTAL**)
* `muni-incorp-state.r` - creates state-specific annual incorporation count data. This contains annual observations by state from 1800 to 2023. Incorporations older than 1800 are accounted for in their own years; however, the time series is not continuous. 
* `muni-incorp.r` - creates individual-level incorporations data

## Contents of /rawdata/
These spreadsheets are the raw data called by the do-files above:
* `disincorp-fips-crosswalk.csv` - geographic crosswalk for disincorporations (**EXPERIMENTAL**)
* `fips_crosswalk.csv` - geographic crosswalk
* `muni-disincorporation.csv` - individual level dates of disincorporation (**EXPERIMENTAL**)
* `muni-incorporation.csv` - individual level dates of incorporation
* `state_fips_crosswalk.csv` - state-specific geographic crosswalk

## Status
This is a work in progress and data collection is on-going. If you have a lead on incorporation data that is currently missing, please do not hesitate to get in touch ([cgoodman@niu.edu](mailto:cgoodman@niu.edu)).
